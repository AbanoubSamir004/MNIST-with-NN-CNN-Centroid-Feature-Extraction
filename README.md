# MNIST-with-Neural-Network-and-Centroid-Feature-Extraction
The project Contains the MNIST dataset, and extract
feature vectors With Centroids. and then we implemented NN with
(check the optimal Parameters) to classify the dataset.
after that we also used CNN to classify the dataset, and we checks all the optimal
Parameters to be used and get high performance.
